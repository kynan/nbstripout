0.1.x branch
------------
Maintained by Florian Rathgeber

* https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout

0.1.0:
  * Based on Min RK's orginal but supports multiple versions of
    IPython/Jupyter and also strips the execution count.
0.2.0:
  * Only process .ipynb files unless -f flag is used
  * Will process multiple files
0.2.7:
  * If you set either the `"init_cell": true` or `"keep_output": true`
    in the cell metadata, then these cells will not be stripped out.
    The former works in conjunction with the `init_cell` nbextension.
