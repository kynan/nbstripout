nbstripout: strip output from Jupyter and IPython notebooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Opens a notebook, strips its output, and writes the outputless version to the
original file.

Useful mainly as a git filter or pre-commit hook for users who don't want to
track output in VCS.

This does mostly the same thing as the `Clear All Output` command in the
notebook UI.

Based on https://gist.github.com/minrk/6176788.

Installation
============

You can download and install the latest version of ``nbstripout`` from PyPI_,
the Python package index, as follows: ::

    pip install --upgrade nbstripout

When using the Anaconda_ Python distribution, install ``nbstripout`` via the
conda_ package manager from conda-forge_: ::

    conda install -c conda-forge nbstripout

Usage
=====

Strip output from IPython / Jupyter notebook (modifies the files in-place): ::

    nbstripout FILE.ipynb [FILE2.ipynb ...]

Force processing of non ``.ipynb`` files: ::

    nbstripout -f FILE.ipynb.bak

Write to stdout e.g. to use as part of a shell pipeline: ::

    cat FILE.ipynb | nbstripout > OUT.ipynb

or ::

    nbstripout -t FILE.ipynb | other-command

Set up the git filter and attributes as described in the manual installation
instructions below: ::

    nbstripout --install

Set up the git filter using ``.gitattributes`` ::

    nbstripout --install --attributes .gitattributes

Set up the git filter in your global ``~/.gitconfig`` ::

    nbstripout --install --global

Remove the git filter and attributes: ::

    nbstripout --uninstall

Remove the git filter from your global ``~/.gitconfig`` and attributes ::

    nbstripout --uninstall --global

Remove the git filter and attributes from ``.gitattributes``: ::

    nbstripout --uninstall --attributes .gitattributes

Check if ``nbstripout`` is installed in the current repository
(exits with code 0 if installed, 1 otherwise): ::

    nbstripout --is-installed

Print status of ``nbstripout`` installation in the current repository and
configuration summary of filter and attributes if installed
(exits with code 0 if installed, 1 otherwise): ::

    nbstripout --status

Print the version: ::

    nbstripout --version

Show this help page: ::

    nbstripout --help

Configuration files
+++++++++++++++++++

The following table shows in which files the ``nbstripout`` filter and
attribute configuration is written to for given extra flags to ``--install``
and ``--uninstall``:

======================================== ================ ========================
flags                                    filters          attributes
======================================== ================ ========================
none                                     ``.git/config``  ``.git/info/attributes``
``--global``                             ``~/.gitconfig`` ``.git/info/attributes``
``--attributes=.gitattributes``          ``.git/config``  ``.gitattributes``
``--global --attributes=.gitattributes`` ``~/.gitconfig`` ``.gitattributes``
======================================== ================ ========================

Install globally
++++++++++++++++

Usually, ``nbstripout`` is installed per repository so you can choose where to
use it or not. You can choose to set the attributes in ``.gitattributes`` and
commit this file to your repository, however there is no way to have git set up
the filters automatically when someone clones a repository. This is by design,
to prevent you from executing arbitrary and potentially malicious code when
cloning a repository.

To install ``nbstripout`` for all your repositories such that you no longer
need to run the installation once per repository, install as follows: ::

    mkdir -p ~/.config/git  # This folder may not exist
    nbstripout --install --global --attributes=~/.config/git/attributes

This will set up the filters and diff driver in your ``~/.gitconfig`` and
instruct git to apply them to any ``.ipynb`` file in any repository.

Note that you need to uninstall with the same flags: ::

    nbstripout --uninstall --global --attributes=~/.config/git/attributes

Apply retroactively
+++++++++++++++++++

``nbstripout`` can be used to rewrite an existing Git repository using
``git filter-branch`` to strip output from existing notebooks. This invocation
uses ``--index-filter`` and operates on all ipynb-files in the repo: ::

    git filter-branch -f --index-filter '
        git checkout -- :*.ipynb
        find . -name "*.ipynb" -exec nbstripout "{}" +
        git add . --ignore-removal
    '

If the repository is large and the notebooks are in a subdirectory it will run
faster with ``git checkout -- :<subdir>/*.ipynb``. You will get a warning for
commits that do not contain any notebooks, which can be suppressed by piping
stderr to ``/dev/null``.

This is a potentially slower but simpler invocation using ``--tree-filter``: ::

    git filter-branch -f --tree-filter 'find . -name "*.ipynb" -exec nbstripout "{}" +'

Keeping some output
+++++++++++++++++++

Do not strip the execution count/prompt number ::

    nbstripout --keep-count

Do not strip the output ::

    nbstripout --keep-output

To mark special cells so that the output is not stripped, set the
``"keep_output": true`` metadata on the cell.  To do this, select the
"Edit Metadata" Cell Toolbar, and then use the "Edit Metadata" button
on the desired cell to enter something like::

    {
      "keep_output": true,
    }

You can also keep output for an entire notebook. This is useful if you want to
strip output by default in an automated environment (e.g. CI pipeline), but want
to be able to keep outputs for some notebooks. To do so, add the option above to
the *notebook* metadata instead. (You can also explicitly remove outputs from
a particular cell in these notebooks by adding a cell-level metadata entry.)

Another use-case is to preserve initialization cells that might load
customized CSS etc. critical for the display of the notebook.  To
support this, we also keep output for cells with::

    {
      "init_cell": true,
    }

This is the same metadata used by the `init_cell nbextension`__.

Stripping metadata
++++++++++++++++++

This is configurable via ``git config (--global) filter.nbstripout.extrakeys``.
An example would be: ::

    git config --global filter.nbstripout.extrakeys '
      metadata.celltoolbar metadata.kernel_spec.display_name
      metadata.kernel_spec.name metadata.language_info.codemirror_mode.version
      metadata.language_info.pygments_lexer metadata.language_info.version
      metadata.toc metadata.notify_time metadata.varInspector
      cell.metadata.heading_collapsed cell.metadata.hidden
      cell.metadata.code_folding cell.metadata.tags cell.metadata.init_cell'

Excluding files and folders
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To exclude specific files or folders from being processed by the ``nbstripout``
filters, add the path and exception to your filter specifications
defined in ``.git/info/attributes`` or ``.gitattributes``: ::

    docs/** filter= diff=

This will disable ``nbstripout`` for any file in the ``docs`` directory.: ::

    notebooks/Analysis.ipynb filter= diff=

This will disable ``nbstripout`` for the file ``Analysis.ipynb`` located in
the ``notebooks`` directory.

To check which attributes a given file has with the current config, run ::

    git check-attr -a -- path/to/file

For a file to which the filter applies you will see the following: ::

    $ git check-attr -a -- foo.ipynb
    foo.ipynb: diff: ipynb
    foo.ipynb: filter: nbstripout

For a file in your excluded folder you will see the following: ::

    $ git check-attr -a -- docs/foo.ipynb
    foo.ipynb: diff:
    foo.ipynb: filter:

Manual filter installation
==========================

Set up a git filter and diff driver using nbstripout as follows: ::

    git config filter.nbstripout.clean '/path/to/nbstripout'
    git config filter.nbstripout.smudge cat
    git config filter.nbstripout.required true
    git config diff.ipynb.textconv '/path/to/nbstripout -t'

This will add a section to the ``.git/config`` file of the current repository.

If you want the filter to be installed globally for your user, add the
``--global`` flag to the ``git config`` invocations above to have the
configuration written to your ``~/.gitconfig`` and apply to all repositories.

Create a file ``.gitattributes`` (if you want it versioned with the repository)
or ``.git/info/attributes`` (to apply it only to the current repository) with
the following content: ::

    *.ipynb filter=nbstripout
    *.ipynb diff=ipynb

This instructs git to use the filter named _nbstripout_ and the diff driver
named _ipynb_ set up in the git config above for every ``.ipynb`` file in the
repository.

If you want the attributes be set for ``.ipynb`` files in any of your git
repositories, add those two lines to ``~/.config/git/attributes``. Note that
this file and the ``~/.config/git`` directory may not exist.

Using ``nbstripout`` as a pre-commit hook
=========================================

`pre-commit`_ is a framework for managing git `pre-commit hooks`_.

Once you have `pre-commit`_ installed, add the follwong to the
``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` in your repository: ::

    repos:
    - repo: https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout
      rev: master
      hooks:
        - id: nbstripout
          files: ".ipynb"

Then run ``pre-commit install`` to activate the hook.

.. warning::
  In this mode, ``nbstripout`` is used as a git hook to strip any ``.ipynb``
  files before committing. This also modifies your working copy!

  In its regular mode, ``nbstripout`` acts as a filter and only modifies what
  git gets to see for committing or diffing. The working copy stays intact.

Troubleshooting
===============

Show files processed by nbstripout filter
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Git has `no builtin support <https://stackoverflow.com/a/52065333/396967>`_
for listing files a clean or smudge filter operates on. As a workaround,
change the setup of your filter in ``.git/config`` or ``~/.gitconfig`` as
follows to see the filenames either filter operates on: ::

    [filter "nbstripout"]
        clean  = "f() { echo >&2 \"clean: nbstripout $1\"; nbstripout; }; f %f"
        smudge = "f() { echo >&2 \"smudge: cat $1\"; cat; }; f %f"
        required = true

Mercurial usage
===============

Mercurial does not have the equivalent of smudge filters.  One can use
an encode/decode hook but this has some issues.  An alternative
solution is to provide a set of commands that first run ``nbstripout``,
then perform these operations. This is the approach of the `mmf-setup`_
package.
